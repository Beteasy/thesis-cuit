    In order to optimize the electronic resources establishment of the university library and improve the customer satisfaction, we conduct an investigation to the teachers and students in the university in the form of questionnaire. In this investigation, we take a sample survey, that is, we classify the subjects into 4 groups: the freshmen and sophomores, the juniors and seniors, the post-graduates, and the teachers; then we do the simple sampling towards each group; next, we design the questionnaire according to a system of customer satisfaction evaluation quota, and evaluate the questions scientifically and rationally based on the five-point Likert scale. After the investigation, we sort out and add up the data, and calculate the degree of the readers’ satisfaction according to the quota system.
